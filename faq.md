### I need a translation. What do I do?

Just fill in the form use the ‘contact me’ section and send me the documents for a free and non-obligation quote. 
Alternatively, you can drop me an email at hola@mariacolell.com if you'd like to talk about your project or provide me with extra details. One of the things I like most about my job is writing and receiving emails. However, I know that many of my clients just don’t have the time. You really don’t have to write long and overly polite emails. A quick “Hello, I need something in Spanish. Help!” will do. Just drop me an email stating what you need and I will come to your rescue.

### It’s just a very short translation and I want it fast.

Then there’s no need for beating around the bush; let’s get straight into business. If I’m free that day I can offer a very quick turnaround, but I’m afraid a couple of formalities are in order nonetheless: simply fill in the form here with your document attached and I will get back at you as soon as possible with a quote.

### It’s a very complicated project and I don’t even know where to start.

Good! Sounds like my kind of project. Let’s brainstorm together!

### I have a word file with 10,000 words that needs to be translated into Spanish. Can you do it for tomorrow morning?

That’s a tricky question. Short answer would be ‘Yes, I can’. Long answer would be ‘I can, but it wouldn’t be good for you’. This fact will shed some light: as an average, a full-time translator translates about 2,000 – 3,000 words per day, depending on the nature of the text.

### How much will it cost me?

That depends. Charges may apply if it’s urgent or it requires working throughout the weekend. Usually prices are calculated on a per word basis, but some specific jobs like transcreation, for example, are charged by the hour. Let's exchange some emails and discuss the fairest rate for you and me. (Did I mention that I love writing emails?)

### Why would I hire a professional translator?

Why wouldn’t you? Hiring a professional linguist is the difference between seeing translation as an ‘expense’ or as an ‘investment’. Using an automated translation can be useful when you're travelling in South East Asia and need some on-the-spot linguistic support, but it will not help you to efficiently communicate with your customers.

### Do you also offer interpretation?

I’m afraid I don’t. However I work with an extensive network of professional translators and interpreters, and I can help you find the right person for the job.

### Are you a qualified translator? Where can I see your credentials?

Yes, I am a fully qualified translator, with a BA and a MA in translation studies and 9 years of experience. I am a native speaker of Spanish and have lived in several countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. I am also committed to life-long learning and I strive for perfection. Not convinced? Take a look at my LinkedIn profile, where you will also find some reviews about my work.

### What languages do you translate from?

I translate mainly from English into Spanish, but I also have experience from French. I am currently working towards adding Swedish to my linguistic combination. Please stay tuned!

### What if I don’t like your translation?

Well, that would be a first! I will always strive to deliver flawlessly written texts which are adapted to the audience and my clients have always praised my work. However, if you are still not fully satisfied with my work I am more than happy to listen to your suggestions and, where applicable, make changes only within a week after my translation was delivered.

### How can I pay you?

You can pay me Paypal or by bank transfer. You’ll find my payment contacts in the quote and in the final invoice.

And last but not least:

### I loved your work. Can I send you some feedback?

Yes, you can! You can drop me an email with your feedback and join my ever-growing list of happy clients.

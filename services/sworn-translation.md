Many legal formalities between countries require the translation of official documents which need to be certified by an official translator. Bureaucracy can be cumbersome but unlike other formalities you can now order your sworn translation with a simple click and receive it a few days later in the comfort of your own home.

## How does it work?

The first step is to write me an email to hello@mariacolell.com with a small explanation about what type of document you need to translate and an approximate deadline. If you attach the scanned document I will reply with a final quote and delivery date.

Once you accept the quote by writing I will start translating.

And that ́s it! In a few days you will receive your document duly translated, sealed and signed.

Payments will be done by bank transfer.

Remember that…

- I will treat your documents with the utmost confidentiality at all times.

- For your peace of mind I will be reachable by email or phone throughout the whole process to answer any questions that may arise

- Many official documents expire in some months or even less, so please keep this in mind when doing your paperwork and ordering the translations. Any questions? Feel free to write me an email with all your doubts to [hello@mariacolell.com](mailto:hello@mariacolell.com) and I ́d be more than happy to solve them.
